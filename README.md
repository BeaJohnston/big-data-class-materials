## Resources to use for class

There are countless free resources on the internet that can be used to learn R. Here are a few that I recommend:

### On R

- [_R_ For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
- [Advanced _R_](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham
- [Geocomputation with _R_ by Robin Lovelace](ttps://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/), Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow
- [_Posit_ Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
- [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)

### On R Markdown

- [_RStudio_ Gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)
- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund

### Econometrics, Statistics, Data Science with R examples

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://statlearning.com) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani
- [Data Science for Economists and Other Animals](https://grantmcdermott.com/ds4e/) by Grant McDermott and Ed Rubin
- [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) by Scott Cunningham
- [The Effect](https://www.theeffectbook.net/) by Nick Huntington-Klein
- [Spatial Data Science](https://r-spatial.org/book/) by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand
- [Data Visualization: A practical introduction](http://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy 

### Staying organized

- [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practioner's Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro
- [Coding for Economists: A Language-Agnostic Guide](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/ristovska/files/coding_for_econs_20190221.pdf)

## Details

This is an undergraduate course taught by [Kyle Coombs](https://kylecoombs.com/). Here is the course description, right out of the [syllabus](https://github.com/big-data-and-economics/big-data-class-materials/blob/main/syllabus/syllabus.pdf):

Economics is at the forefront of developing statistical methods for analyzing data collected from uncontrolled sources. Since econometrics addresses challenges in estimation such as sample selection bias and treatment effects identification, the discipline is well-suited for the analysis of large and unsystematically collected datasets. This course introduces statistical (machine) learning methods, which have been developed for analyzing such datasets but which have only recently been implemented in economic research. We will cover a variety of topics including data collection, data management, data description, causal inference, and data visualization.  The course also explores how econometrics and statistical learning methods cross-fertilize and can be used to advance knowledge in the numerous domains where large volumes of data are rapidly accumulating. We will also cover the ethics of data collection and analysis. The course will be taught in *R*. 

## FAQ

### If you find a typo in these lecture notes

Please raise an issue or submit a pull request. For those taking this course, I offer a 2.5% bonus on your final grade for issuing a *pull request* to any open source material -- including these lecture notes. This can be to fix a typo or to fix a bug in the code. 



### How do I download this material and keep up to date with any changes?

Please note that this is a work in progress, with new material being added every week. 

If you just want to read the lecture slides or HTML notebooks in your browser, then you should simply scroll up to the [Lectures](#lectures) section at the top of this page. Completed lectures will be hyperlinked as soon as they have been added. Remember to check back in regularly to get any updates. Or, you can watch or star the repo to get notified automatically.

If you actually want to run the analysis and code on your own system (highly recommended), then you will need to download the material to your local machine. The best way to do this is to clone the repo via Git and then pull regularly to get updates. Please take a look at [these slides](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/main/02-git/02-git.html) if you are unfamiliar with Git or are unsure how to do any of that. Once that's done, you will find each lecture contained in a numbered folder (e.g. `01-intro`). The lectures themselves are written in R Markdown and then exported to HMTL format. Click on the HTML files if you just want to view the slides or notebooks.

### I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute

Please [open a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Better yet, please fork the repo and [submit an upstream pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). I'm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond while this course is still be developed. Similarly, I am unlikely to help with software troubleshooting or conceptual difficulties for non-enrolled students. Others may feel free to jump in, though.

### Can I use/adapt your material for a similar course that I'm teaching?

Sure. I already borrowed half of it Grant McDermott, Tyler Ransom, Raj Chetty, and Stephen Hansen (links to their pages to come). I have also kept everything publicly available. I ask two favours (like Grant McDermott) 1) Please let me know ([email](mailto:kcoombs@bates.edu) if you do use material from this course, or have found it useful in other ways. 2) An acknowledgment somewhere in your own syllabus or notes would be much appreciated.
