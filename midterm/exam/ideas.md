## T/F

As the sum of the squared residuals (SSE) increases, our standard errors also increase.
TRUE

A misspecified model can cause heteroskedasticityâ€”even when the properly specified model is homoskedastic.
TRUE

In practice (the 'real world'), you should generally avoid heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
FALSE

If you use heteroskedasticty-robust standard errors when the disturbances are actually homoskedastic, then your standard errors are biased. (Assume all other requirements/assumptions for OLS are met.)
FALSE
If you use homoskedasticity-assuming standard errors when the disturbances are actually heteroskedastic, then your standard errors are biased. (Assume all other requirements/assumptions for OLS are met.)
TRUE
If you use heteroskedasticty-robust standard errors when the disturbances are actually homoskedastic, then your coefficient estimates are biased. (Assume all other requirements/assumptions for OLS are met.)
FALSE
If you use homoskedasticity-assuming standard errors when the disturbances are actually heteroskedastic, then your coefficient estimates are biased. (Assume all other requirements/assumptions for OLS are met.)
FALSE

If you square an indicator variable, the resulting squared variable will be identical to the original variable.
TRUE

If the distribution of an estimator collapses to a "spike" at the target parameter as the sample size (n) goes to infinity, then the estimator is unbiased.
FALSE

The White test for heteroskedasticity is able to test for more types of heteroskedasticity than the Bresch-Pagan test.
TRUE

In the model
Health = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Income + \beta_2 Age + u
The effect of "Income" on "Health" depends upon the individual's age.
FALSE

A static time-series model does not include lags of the explanatory variables.
TRUE

Measurement error (as defined in class) biases OLS away from zero.
FALSE

A dataset that observes the same individual for multiple time periods is an example of cross-sectional data.
FALSE

Weighted least squares (WLS) "up-weights" high-variance observations and "down-weights" low-variance observations.
FALSE

Suppose that you actually observe the disturbance (u_i) and that you are interested in the regression
Income_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Education_i + \beta_2 Ability_i + u_i
You plot the disturbance against each explanatory variable, and u_i has no relationship with either explanatory variable. 
You can conclude that exogeneity is satisfied.
TRUE

A log-linear model implicitly assumes an exponential relationship between the outcome and the explanatory variable. A fully linear model does not assume this exponential relationship.
TRUE

Exogeneity requires that the disturbances are uncorrelated with each other.
FALSE

A standard error tells us about the variation in an estimator's distribution.
TRUE

Omitted-variable bias tends to bias coefficients toward zero.
FALSE

Omitted-variable bias occurs when you omit a variable from your regression.
FALSE

Our standard OLS assumptions require that Var(x) = 0.
FALSE

If our assumption of exogeneity is satisfied, then Cov(x,u) = 0.
TRUE

In a Goldfeld-Quandt test, if SSE_1 and SSE_2 are approximately equal, will typically conclude there is no significant evidence of heteroskedasticity.
TRUE
In a Goldfeld-Quandt test, if SSE_1 and SSE_2 are approximately equal, then there is no heteroskedasticity.
FALSE

An estimator can be consistent without being unbiased.
TRUE
An estimator can inconsistent while being unbiased.
TRUE

- We observe statistically significant evidence of homoskedasticity.
- We observe statistically significant evidence of heteroskedasticty.
- We do not observe statistically significant evidence of homoskedasticity.
- We do not observe statistically significant evidence of heteroskedasticty.
