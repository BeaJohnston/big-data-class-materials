# For problem set

On the problem set you'll be using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort (**NLSY 1997**).

- This is a long-running survey of a representative sample of U.S. youth born between 1980 and 1984.

- The data is available from the [NLS Investigator](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/search) website.

- I've provided a zipped folder with the data in the `data/raw` folder, which you can access from the problem set

- You may not recognize all the file extensions, but the [NLSY documentation](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/access-data-investigator/investigator-user-guide/zip-file-contents) can help

- The key file to note is `nlsy1997-ps2.NLSY97` is a tagset file that you can upload to the NLS Investigator to get an exact copy of the data to use for the problem set
  - Further details provided on the problem set
  - **Replication** alert: tagsets are one way to ensure that your data is reproducible.

# What is "tidy" data?

### Resources:
- [Vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) (from the **tidyr** package)
- [Original paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) (Hadley Wickham, 2014 JSS)

--

</br>

### Key points:
1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

--

</br>

Basically, tidy data is more likely to be [long (i.e. narrow) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) than wide format.

# Relational Database Management with R

- Remember Relational Database Management from our work on [Empirical Organization](https://raw.githack.com/big-data-and-economics/big-data-class-materials/main/lectures/02-empirical-workflow/02-empirical-workflow.html#1)?

- Today, we'll learn how to implement it using packages in the `tidyverse`

- We'll cover:
  - Subsetting data
  - Variable creation, renaming, selection
  - Grouping and summarizing data
  - Joining and appending datasets

# Tidyverse vs. base R

(Almost) everything you can do in the tidyverse can be done in base R without loading new packages.

I won't delve into the debate, because I think the answer is [clear](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/): We should teach the tidyverse first (or, at least, early).
- The documentation and community support are outstanding.
- Having a consistent philosophy and syntax makes it easier to learn.
- Provides a convenient "front-end" to big data tools.
- For data cleaning, wrangling, and plotting, the tidyverse really is a no-brainer.<sup>1</sup>

--

**But**... this certainly shouldn't put you off learning base R alternatives.
- Base R is extremely flexible and powerful (and stable).
- There are some things that you'll have to venture outside of the tidyverse for.
- A combination of tidyverse and base R is often the best solution to a problem.
- Excellent base R data manipulation tutorials: [here](https://www.rspatial.org/intr/index.html) and [here](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR).

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> I'm also a huge fan of [**data.table**](http://r-datatable.com/). This package will be the subject of our next lecture.
]

---

# Tidyverse vs. base R (cont.)

One point of convenience is that there is often a direct correspondence between a tidyverse command and its base R equivalent. 

These generally follow a `tidyverse::snake_case` vs `base::period.case` rule. E.g. Compare:

| tidyverse  |  base |
|---|---|
| `?readr::read_csv`  | `?utils::read.csv` |
| `?dplyr::if_else` |  `?base::ifelse` |
| `?tibble::tibble` |  `?base::data.frame` |

Etcetera.
  
If you call up the above examples, you'll see that the tidyverse alternative typically offers some enhancements or other useful options (and sometimes restrictions) over its base counterpart.

--

**Remember:** There are (almost) always multiple ways to achieve a single goal in R.

---

# Tidyverse packages

Let's load the tidyverse meta-package and check the output.
```{r tverse, cache = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

--

We see that we have actually loaded a number of packages (which could also be loaded individually): **ggplot2**, **tibble**, **dplyr**, etc.
- We can also see information about the package versions and some [namespace conflicts](https://raw.githack.com/big-data-and-economics/big-data-class-materials/main/lectures/04-rlang/04-rlang.html#62). 
<!-- TK : change lecture notes to mine -->
---

# Tidyverse packages (cont.)

The tidyverse actually comes with a lot more packages than those loaded automatically.<sup>1</sup>
```{r tverse_pkgs}
tidyverse_packages()
```

We'll use most of these packages during the remainder of this course.

- E.g. The **lubridate** for dates, **rvest** for webscraping, **broom** to `tidy()` R objects into tables
- However, bear in mind that these packages will have to be loaded separately with `library()`

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> It also includes a *lot* of dependencies upon installation. This is a matter of some [controversy](http://www.tinyverse.org/).
]

---

# Tidyverse packages (cont.)

We will cover most of the tidyverse packages over the length of this course.

Today, however, I'm only really going to focus on two packages: 
1. [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
2. [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

These are the workhorse packages for cleaning and wrangling data. They are thus the ones that you will likely make the most use of (alongside **ggplot2**, which we already met back in Lecture 1).
- Data cleaning and wrangling occupies an inordinate amount of time, no matter where you are in your research career.

---
class: inverse, center, middle
name: dplyr

# dplyr

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

--

*Note:* **dplyr** 1.0.0 also notifies you about grouping variables every time you do operations on or with them. YMMV, but, personally, I find these messages annoying and so prefer to [switch them off](https://twitter.com/MattCowgill/status/1278463099272491008).

```r
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE) ## Add to .Rprofile to make permanent
```

---

# Key dplyr verbs

There are five key dplyr verbs that you need to learn.

1. `filter`: Filter (i.e. subset) rows based on their values.

2. `arrange`: Arrange (i.e. reorder) rows based on their values.

3. `select`: Select (i.e. subset) columns by their names: 

4. `mutate`: Create new columns.

5. `summarise`: Collapse multiple rows into a single summary value.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> `summarize` with a "z" works too, but Hadley Wickham is from New Sealand.
]

---
# Learn the verbs

Practice these commands together using the `starwars` data frame that comes pre-packaged with dplyr. **Stop** when you hit the last `summarise` slide (approx. 33). 

```{r see-starwars}
starwars
```

---
name: filter

# 1) dplyr::filter

Filter means "subset" the rows of a data frame based on some condition(s). 

```{r filter1}
filter(starwars, species == "Human", height >= 190)
```

---
# 1) dplyr::filter *cont.* (pipes)

We can chain multiple commands with the pipe `%>%` from the **magrittr** package<sup>1</sup>.
```{r filter_pipe}
starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Human", height >= 190)
```

.footnote[<sup>1</sup> Pipes were invented by Doug McIlroy in 1964, are widely used in Unix shells (e.g. bash) and other programming languages (e.g. `F#`). They pass the preceding object as the first argument to the following function. In R, they
allow you to chain together code in a way that reads from left to right.]

---
# 1) dplyr::filter *cont.*

String operations from the **stringr** package are also auto-loaded with **tidyverse** and work well with `filter` too. 
```{r filter2}
starwars %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name,'Skywalker')) # str_detect is from the stringr package
```

---

# 1) dplyr::filter *cont.*

A very common `filter` use case is identifying (or removing) missing data cases. 
```{r filter3}
starwars %>% 
  filter(is.na(height))
```

To remove missing observations, simply use negation: `filter(!is.na(height))`. Try this yourself.

---
name: arrange

# 2) dplyr::arrange

```{r arrange1}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(birth_year)
```

--

*Note:* Arranging on a character-based column (i.e. strings) will sort alphabetically. Try this yourself by arranging according to the "name" column.

---

# 2) dplyr::arrange *cont.*

We can also arrange items in descending order using `arrange(desc())`.
```{r arrange2}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(desc(birth_year))
```

---
name: select

# 3) dplyr::select

Select means subset the columns of a data frame based on their names. 

Use commas to select multiple columns out of a data frame. (You can also use "first:last" for consecutive columns). Deselect a column with "-".
```{r select1}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:skin_color, species, -height) %>% 
  head()
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select *cont.*

You can also rename some (or all) of your selected variables in place.
```{r select2}
starwars %>%
  select(alias=name, crib=homeworld, sex=gender) %>% 
  head()
```

--

If you just want to rename columns without subsetting them, you can use `rename`. Try this now by replacing `select(...)` in the above code chunk with `rename(...)`.

---

# 3) dplyr::select *cont.*

The `select(contains(PATTERN))` option provides a nice shortcut in relevant cases.
```{r select3}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, contains("color")) %>% 
  head()
```

---
name: mutate

# 4) dplyr::mutate

You can create new columns from scratch, or (more commonly) as transformations of existing columns.
```{r mutate1}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, birth_year) %>%
  mutate(dog_years = birth_year * 7) %>%
  mutate(comment = paste0(name, " is ", dog_years, " in dog years.")) %>%
  head()
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate *cont.*

*Note:* `mutate` is order aware. So you can chain multiple mutates in a single call.
```{r mutate2}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, birth_year) %>%
  mutate(
    dog_years = birth_year * 7, ## Separate with a comma
    comment = paste0(name, " is ", dog_years, " in dog years.")) %>%
    head()
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate *cont.*

Boolean, logical and conditional operators all work well with `mutate` too.
```{r mutate3}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Luke Skywalker", "Anakin Skywalker")) %>% 
  mutate(tall1 = height > 180) %>%
  mutate(tall2 = ifelse(height > 180, "Tall", "Short")) ## Same effect, but can choose labels

```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate *cont.*

Lastly, combining `mutate` with the `across` feature allows you to easily work on a subset of variables. For example:

```{r, mutate4}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:eye_color) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), \(x) toupper(x))) %>% #<< 
  head(5)
```

--

Try to intuit what `\(x)` does above!

---
name: summarise

# 5) dplyr::summarise

Particularly useful in combination with the `group_by` command.
```{r summ1}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species, gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  head()
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise *cont.*

Note that including "na.rm = TRUE" (or,  its alias "na.rm = T") is usually a good idea with summarise functions. Otherwise, your output will be missing too. 
```{r summ2}
## Probably not what we want
starwars %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height))
## Much better
starwars %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise *cont.*

The same `across`-based workflow that we saw with `mutate` a few slides back also works with `summarise`. For example:

```{r summ4}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) (mean(x, na.rm=T)))) %>% #<<
  head()
```

---

# Other dplyr goodies

`group_by` and `ungroup`: For (un)grouping.
- Particularly useful with the `summarise` and `mutate` commands, as we've already seen.

--

`slice`: Subset rows by position rather than filtering by values.
- `starwars %>% slice(c(1, 5))`

--

`pull`: Extract a column as a vector or scalar.
- `starwars %>% filter(gender=="female") %>% pull(height)` returns `height` as a vector

--

`count` and `distinct`: Number and isolate unique observations.
- `starwars %>% count(species)`, or `starwars %>% distinct(species)`
- Or use `mutate`, `group_by`, and `n()`, e.g. `starwars %>% group_by(species) %>% mutate(num = n())`.

There are also [window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) for leads and lags, ranks, cumulative aggregation, etc.
- See `vignette("window-functions")`.

name: combining

# Combining data frames

The final set of dplyr "goodies" are the family of **append** and **join** operations. However, these are important enough that I want to go over some concepts in a bit more depth...

- We will encounter and practice these many more times as the course progresses.

- Imagine you have two data frames, `df1` and `df2`, that you want to combine.

  - You can **append**: stack the datasets on top of each other and match up the columns
  - You can **merge** (AKA a **join**): match the rows based on a common identifier

- Each of these is possible with base R, **dplyr**, and **data.table**.

- The appropriate choice depends on the task you are trying to accomplish
  
  - Are you trying to add new observations or new variables?

---

---
name: append
# Appending 

- One way to append in the `tidyverse` is with `bind_rows()`
  - Base R has `rbind()`, which requires column names to match 
  - `data.table` has `rbindlist()`, which requires column names to match unless you specify `fill`

```{r, append}
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)
df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 10:13, z=letters[1:4])

## Append df2 to df1
bind_rows(df1, df2)
```

---
name: joins

# Joins

One of the mainstays of the dplyr package is merging data with the family [join operations](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html).
- `inner_join(df1, df2)`
- `left_join(df1, df2)`
- `right_join(df1, df2)`
- `full_join(df1, df2)`
- `semi_join(df1, df2)`
- `anti_join(df1, df2)`

Joins are how you get .hi[Relational Database Managment] (RDBM) to work in R. 

(See visual depictions of the different join operations [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).)


--

For the simple examples that I'm going to show here, we'll need some data sets that come bundled with the [**nycflights13**](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package. 
- Load it now and then inspect these data frames in your own console.

```{r flights, echo = F}
library(nycflights13)
```
```{r, eval = F}
library(nycflights13)
flights 
planes
```

- Any variable names in common?
- Are the definitions of these variables consistent across data frames?

---

# Joins (cont.)

<div align="center">
<img src="pics/merge_ex-1536x936.png" height=500>
</div>

---

# Joins (cont.)

Let's perform a [left join](https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html#left_joinsuperheroes-publishers) on the flights and planes datasets. 
- *Note*: I'm going subset columns after the join, but only to keep text on the slide.

--

```{r join1}
left_join(flights, planes) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model)
```

---

# Joins (cont.)

(*continued from previous slide*)

Note that dplyr made a reasonable guess about which columns to join on (i.e. columns that share the same name). It also told us its choices: 

```
*## Joining, by = c("year", "tailnum")
```

However, there's a problem here: the variable "year" does not have a consistent meaning across our joining datasets!
- In one it refers to the *year of flight*, in the other it refers to *year of construction*.

--

Luckily, there's an easy way to avoid this problem. 
- See if you can figure it out before turning to the next slide.
- Try `?dplyr::join`.

- Submit your answer to https://www.menti.com using code `97 37 37 3`

---

# Joins (cont.)

(*continued from previous slide*)

You just need to be more explicit in your join call by using the `by = ` argument.
- You can also rename any ambiguous columns to avoid confusion. 
```{r join2}
left_join(
  flights,
  planes %>% rename(year_built = year), ## Not necessary w/ below line, but helpful
  by = "tailnum" ## Be specific about the joining column
  ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, year_built, type, model) %>%
  head(3) ## Just to save vertical space on the slide
```

---

# Joins (cont.)

(*continued from previous slide*)

Last thing I'll mention for now; note what happens if we again specify the join column... but don't rename the ambiguous "year" column in at least one of the given data frames.
```{r join3}
left_join(
  flights,
  planes, ## Not renaming "year" to "year_built" this time
  by = "tailnum"
  ) %>%
  select(contains("year"), month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model) %>%
  head(3)
```

--

Make sure you know what "year.x" and "year.y" are. Again, it pays to be specific.

# Key tidyr verbs

1. `pivot_longer`: Pivot wide data into long format.<sup>1</sup> 

2. `pivot_wider`: Pivot long data into wide format.<sup>2</sup> 

3. `separate`: Separate (i.e. split) one column into multiple columns.

4. `unite`: Unite (i.e. combine) multiple columns into one.

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Updated version of `tidyr::gather`.

<sup>2</sup> Updated version of `tidyr::spread`.
]  

--

</br>

Let's practice these verbs together in class.
- Side question: Which of `pivot_longer` vs `pivot_wider` produces "tidy" data?
  
---
name: pivot_longer

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

```{r pivot_longer1}
stocks = data.frame( ## Could use "tibble" instead of "data.frame" if you prefer
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:1,
  X = rnorm(2, 0, 1), Y = rnorm(2, 0, 2), Z = rnorm(2, 0, 4))
stocks
tidy_stocks = stocks %>% pivot_longer(-time, names_to="stock", values_to="price")
tidy_stocks
```

---
name: pivot_wider

# 2) tidyr::pivot_wider

```{r pivot_wider1}
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from=stock, values_from=price)
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from=time, values_from=price)
```

--

</br>
Note that the second example &mdash; which has combined different pivoting arguments &mdash; has effectively transposed the data.

---
# 2) tidyr::pivot_longer with prefix

Let's pivot the pre-loaded billboard data: showing weekly rankings of top 100 in the year 2000

```{r billboard}
head(billboard)
```

---
# 2) tidyr::pivot_longer with prefix *cont.*

Wait, why is there 'wk' in the 'week' column?

```{r pivot_longer3}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with('wk'), names_to="week", 
    values_to="rank") %>%
  head()
```

Try to fix with the `names_prefix` argument. Submit your answer to https://www.menti.com using code `97 37 37 3`

---
# 2) tidyr::pivot_longer with prefix *cont.*

That fixed it. 

```{r pivot_longer4}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with('wk'), names_to="week", 
    values_to="rank",names_prefix='wk') %>%
  mutate(week=as.numeric(week)) %>% # Make week a numeric variable
  head()
```

---

# Aside: Remembering the pivot_* syntax 

There's a long-running joke about no-one being able to remember Stata's "reshape" command. ([Exhibit A](https://twitter.com/helleringer143/status/1117234887902285836).)

It's easy to see this happening with the `pivot_*` functions too. Remember the documentation is your friend! 

```{r pivot_help,eval=FALSE}

name: separate

# 3) tidyr::separate

```{r sep1}
economists = data.frame(name = c("Adam.Smith", "Paul.Samuelson", "Milton.Friedman"))
economists
economists %>% separate(name, c("first_name", "last_name")) 
```

This command is pretty smart at detecting separators. But to avoid ambiguity, you can also specify the separation character with `separate(..., sep=".")`.

---

# 3) tidyr::separate *cont.*

A related function is `separate_rows`, for splitting up cells that contain multiple fields or observations (a frustratingly common occurence with survey data).

```{r sep2}
jobs = data.frame(
  name = c("Jack", "Jill"),
  occupation = c("Homemaker", "Philosopher, Philanthropist, Troublemaker") 
  ) 
jobs
## Now split out Jill's various occupations into different rows
jobs %>% separate_rows(occupation)
```

name: unite

# 4) tidyr::unite

```{r unite1}
gdp = data.frame(
  yr = rep(2016, times = 4),
  mnth = rep(1, times = 4),
  dy = 1:4,
  gdp = rnorm(4, mean = 100, sd = 2)
  )
gdp 
## Combine "yr", "mnth", and "dy" into one "date" column
gdp %>% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-")
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite *cont.*

Note that `unite` will automatically create a character variable. You can see this better if we convert it to a tibble. 
```{r unite2}
gdp_u = gdp %>% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-") %>% as_tibble()
gdp_u
```

--

If you want to convert it to something else (e.g. date or numeric) then you will need to modify it using `mutate`. See the next slide for an example, using the [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) package's super helpful date conversion functions.

---

# 4) tidyr::unite *cont.*

*(continued from previous slide)*

```{r unite3, message=F}
library(lubridate)
gdp_u %>% mutate(date = ymd(date))
```

# Other tidyr goodies

- `fill`: Fill in missing values with the last non-missing value.
  - `fill(df, starts_with("X"))` will fill in missing values in all columns that start with "X".

- `drop_na`: Drop rows with missing values.

- `expand`: Create a complete set of combinations from a set of factors.

- `nest` and `unnest`: Combine columns into lists within a single cell or split a column of lists into separate rows.
  - Try with the `starwars` data frame: `unnest(starwars, films,names_sep='')`

- And much, much more
